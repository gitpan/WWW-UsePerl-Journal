0.23	2009-11-06

	  connection is available.

0.22	2008-09-29

	  to use.perl.org. (RT#38998 - thanks Dave).
	- updated optional tests.
	- closed security risk in entrytitled (RT#37177 - thanks Yanick)

0.21	2007-11-07
	- updated date testing to try and capture problems CPAN testers are
	  seeing.
	- updated an entry test in the event no content is returned.

0.20	2007-11-07
	- username or userid MUST be provided to new().
	- added debug() method to turn internal debugging on or off.
	- internal function _journalsearch_content renamed to _recent_content().
	- added debug testing script.

0.19	2007-11-05
	- fixed user names with other characters in aside from \w.
	- rewrote the the recent list testing, as posts can appear between
	  extracts.
	- missing entries can have to 2 different error messages, depending
	  upon context.
	- added futher diagnostics in the event of errors.
	- reversed login checks, now assumes failure unless validated.

0.18	2007-11-04
	- changed constants to variable due to suprious errors from 
	  Test::Pod::Coverage.
	- added raw() functions for debugging purposes.
	- changed date processing slightly, hopefully this finally fixes those
	  errors. (thanks to Andreas and Slaven for the feedback)

0.17	2007-10-31
	- Still getting CPAN Tester failures :( It looks like use.perl is
	  timing out, as it's unable to reference the test users (russell and 
	  147 (koschei)). The tests now skip, reporting the error, so I can
	  keep an eye on it.
	- More error reporting in tests if results not as expected, so that
	  CPAN Testers reports can hopefully identify specific problems.

0.16	2007-03-14
	- relaxed date testing, as timezones can affect the date/time value
	  returned.

0.15	2007-03-05
	- fixed several test bugs, including the date parsing issues.
	- WUJ::Post->new() now takes a hash as it states in the docs.
	- Rewrote some of the internals so they correctly cache results. 
	- Bit of an overhaul of the code so that underlying Entry objects are 
	  returned more appropriate, with the caller able to access the Entry
	  methods more directly. 
	- Error handling rewritten so the modules don't fail under pressure,
	  just return undef and set an $j->error().
	- Post.pm has had a fresh look and form completion has been updated.
	- Lots more testing, including developer only tests (not included).
	- Handwritten META.yml to conform to current specs.
	- Changed all instances of LICENCE to LICENSE.
	- Added META.yml test script.
	- Added LICENSE file.
	- Renamed the contrib directory to examples.
	- POD/README updates.
	- Devel::Cover - 93.3% (including developer only tests)

0.14	2005-09-22
	- updated journal post code (RT #4718)

	  who wrote the entry, this may not be fixable if we cannot
	  determine that user's timezone.

	- Patch from Spoon

	- "It produces potentially weird results due to time zones. But I believe
